"""Build pack recipes (data/packs/<id>.json) from the source rosters in data/.

A recipe is everything the server and the site need to know about a pack: its name, its odds and pity rules,
and every team in it with that team's rarity. Adding a pack means adding an entry to PACKS and rerunning this.
